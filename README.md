👋 Hi there, I’m [@hanzholahs](https://www.github.com/hanzholahs).

🧑‍💼 I'm a payment system analyst at Bank Indonesia working on the modernization of [BI-RTGS System](https://www.bi.go.id/en/fungsi-utama/sistem-pembayaran/nilai-besar/Default.aspx) and development of [Digital Rupiah](https://www.bi.go.id/en/rupiah/digital-rupiah/default.aspx) (Indonesian central bank digital currency). Besides, I'm a part-time Graduate Diploma student in Computer Science at University of London, learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
